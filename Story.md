# Title: The Riddle of Emberwing
## Chapter 1: The Whispering Winds

Once upon a time, in the mist-veiled kingdom of Eldwyn, an ancient riddle echoed across the winds. None knew where it began or who first spoke it, but it was said that solving the riddle would awaken long-lost powers and bring peace to a fractured world.

Our story begins with Tarin, a curious and clever young shepherd who lived on the outskirts of the sleepy village of Brelmere. Though he led a quiet life tending sheep and reading old books, Tarin yearned for something more—something legendary.

One gray morning, while exploring the glen near the edge of the forest, Tarin stumbled upon a stone obelisk half-buried in moss. Words were carved into its face in glowing runes:

“In flame I slept, in storm I woke. My heart was stolen, my wings revoked. Seek the eye, the scale, the stone—return them, and I’ll fly home.”

Tarin’s heart raced. This was it—the ancient riddle of legend.

## Chapter 2: The Sky Cracks

Before Tarin could investigate further, the earth trembled, and the sky split with the roar of thunder. Villagers came running with news: a dragon was missing from the Isle of Embers, the sacred volcanic island far across the sea. The dragon, Emberwing, was the guardian of Eldwyn’s balance. Without him, crops failed, storms raged, and the wild beasts grew restless.

Tarin rushed home only to find disaster had already reached his doorstep. His mother, Miren, had fallen gravely ill. The village healer said the land’s magic was fading—without Emberwing, the roots of nature were unraveling.

A choice loomed like a shadow. The obelisk’s riddle, the missing dragon, his mother’s condition—they were all connected. Tarin knew what he had to do.

## Chapter 3: The First Clue – The Eye of the Dragon

Tarin packed lightly: a waterskin, an old satchel, a map, and a wooden flute his mother had carved. The village elder offered him a final gift: a silver pendant said to glow in the presence of dragonkind.

The first clue in the riddle—the Eye—was rumored to lie in the Crystal Caverns, northeast of Brelmere. Tarin set off through the Birchwood Path, where travelers often went missing in the fog.

Puzzle: Tarin must collect three glowing mushrooms scattered through the fog to light a path in the cavern’s entrance. Only when placed in the mossy basin outside the cave does the door open.

Inside, reflections danced along the walls, forming illusions of Emberwing. At the heart of the cave, a pedestal held a brilliant gem shaped like a reptilian eye.

As he claimed the Eye of the Dragon, the cavern trembled, and a gust of hot wind burst from within. Something ancient had stirred.

## Chapter 4: The Scale of Ember

The second piece—the Scale—was rumored to rest in Ashen Hollow, an abandoned village scorched by dragonfire long ago. Tarin traveled south through the Whispering Marsh, navigating with his pendant, which shimmered faintly.

Puzzle: Tarin must explore three burned homes in Ashen Hollow to find hidden notes from the village’s last seer, which together form the phrase: “In the hearth of sorrow, scales endure.” This hints at the central firepit.

Digging beneath the cracked hearthstone, Tarin found a massive crimson scale, warm to the touch.

As he held it up, a voice whispered through the wind: “I remember you.” Emberwing was awakening—he was on his way home.

## Chapter 5: The Stone of Storms

The final object—the Stone—was said to be kept by the Storm Monks of Skyreach, in the cliffs far to the west. Tarin’s journey took him through wind-blasted passes and rickety rope bridges.

Reaching the monastery atop the cliffs, he found it abandoned. Scrolls lay scattered, and the great bell had fallen. In the center hall, a puzzle was carved into the floor:

“When flame meets eye, and scale bears weight, the storm shall part the sky’s own gate.”

Puzzle: Tarin places the Eye and Scale into sockets on the floor, causing a bolt of lightning to strike the center, revealing the Stone of Storms, a shard of enchanted obsidian that hummed with energy.

At that moment, the skies cleared, and a roar echoed in the distance.

## Chapter 6: Crossing Paths

Descending from Skyreach, Tarin found the land stirring—plants reviving, winds calming, rivers flowing clearer. Yet, with each step, a dread rose in his chest. What if he failed? What if Emberwing never truly returned? His mother’s time was running short.

Suddenly, the silver pendant flared. A colossal shadow passed overhead. Emberwing—golden-scaled, scarred and mighty—was flying toward Tarin.

They met in a thunder-blasted valley as lightning arced above them. Emberwing landed, his eyes glowing with memory.

“I was deceived,” the dragon rumbled. “A hunter stole my essence, scattered it. You brought me back.”

Tarin offered the Eye, the Scale, and the Stone. Emberwing inhaled them into his body, wings spreading wide once more.

## Chapter 7: The Return

With Tarin on his back, Emberwing soared above the kingdom. Fire and wind trailed behind him, cleansing the blight. When they reached Brelmere, villagers wept at the sight. Emberwing landed gently by Tarin’s home, and a soft wave of golden magic flowed from his heart.

Miren stirred. Her color returned. She opened her eyes and smiled weakly at her son.

“You did it,” she whispered.

## Chapter 8: The Consequence

Tarin should have been joyful, but as Emberwing turned to leave, a heavy truth sank in. He saw visions—the riddle was a cycle. Had he failed, the land would have fallen to ruin. Nature’s balance, his mother’s life, the kingdom’s survival—they all hinged on one choice.

Emberwing looked back once more.

“Next time,” the dragon said, “another must solve the riddle. Until then, I fly.”

And with that, he vanished into the clouds.

## Epilogue: A New Riddle

Years later, children gathered around an old man in Brelmere, who told stories of dragons and ancient puzzles.

And one day, a new obelisk appeared on the edge of the glen—its face carved with new glowing runes.

A new riddle waited.
